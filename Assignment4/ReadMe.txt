 Question 1 -- Several methods were implemented in LinkedBinaryTree.java and ArrayList.java.
               car.java is the decision tree that I developed. Test cases are shown in screenshots
               and in driver.java.
 Question 2 -- The balance tree method is contained in LinkedBinarySearchTree.java "balanceTree()".
